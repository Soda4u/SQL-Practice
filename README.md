# SQL-Practice

In my journey of learning data tools, I am constantly looking for ways to learn and develop new skills, especially for languages like SQL. [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com/) is a website I came across while looking for ways to do just that. It is a simple website, where a user is prompted to answer a question through SQL queries, categorized by varying levels of difficulty.

I completed the availble prompts from all difficulty catergories, and wanted to upload it into my github to access whenever I needed to, and to show my accomplishments.

In the complementary json file in this repository, the "userSolution" key holds the values of all the SQL queries I wrote while completing the prompts available on the website. This json file was exported from sql-practice.com from my own local device.

## Thoughts and Opinions

I thought this resource was really great. All the required tools are given: a database with multiple related tables, a way to check if the query answers the prompt or not (or even works at all), and hints in case the user is stuck. 

The prompts are, in my opinion, accurately represented by the difficulty levels. The Easy difficulty is all about the SQL basics: basic SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses. The Medium difficulty adds in more skills like aggregate functions, JOIN clauses, and problem-solving. The Hard difficulty adds more advanced skills like sub-querying, CASE functions, aggregate functions within other functions, etc. 

If you are someone who works with SQL, whether professionally or personally, I encourage you to check out this website, as I believe it's a great tool for polishing your SQL skills for all levels of proficiency.
